Assumptions:
	
	Array list are fastest at single item insertion
	Hash tables are fastest for single item retrieval
	Sorted lists would take the longest to search for a single item
Findings:

1.  Average insertion time for one object was much faster in a sorted list than the rest of the collections objects
2.  Hash table insertion time was the longest.
3.  Array list was fast at searching for a single item
4.  Sorted list took the longest in retrieving a single item.
5.  Hash table was fastest at retrieving a block of data by quite a bit.
6.  Dictionary was slowest when retrieving a block of data.

Conclusion:

	From a performance standard, I would say that each has its strengths and could be considered to have the 
	best performance based on the requirements of the program.
