Various data structures are used to address storage requirements in the most efficient manner. Often a
tradeoff needs to be made between performance and resource utilization. This assignment asks you to
measure the performance between several commonly-used structures.

Requirements

Answer the question:
“From a performance perspective, which is best – an ArrayList, SortedList, Hashtable or Dictionary?”
To answer the question, you need to design a set of tests that measures the speed of inserting data and
retrieving data. When retrieving data, you might consider single item retrieval, a block of items retrieved
based on certain criteria, and retrieving a sorted list of items. But you can certainly add more cases to
your tests.

This is fairly open ended. You may use a form or console-based application.
Hand in all the source code AND a brief discussion about your findings.
